## Load in a dataset

```{r}

# Reads in a dataset
# 2 types of paths; absolute (the full path) vs relative (only refers to the relevant files)
# getwd() pulls the absolute path until your current working directory

# instead uses a relative path. the "." means "start here"; ".." means "one directory up"; "..." means 2 up...
litters_data <- read_csv(file = "./data/FAS_litters.csv")   # uses relative path
litters_data <- janitor::clean_names(litters_data)          # the "::" means x package::function in package


```
